        "Introduction: - This document summarizes the literature review of the paper: - “Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces: Recognition sing class specification linear projection”.This paper was published in 1997. (Belhumeur, Hespanha and Kriegman, 1997)\n",
        "Peter Belhumeur, Joao Hespanha and David Jriegman have authorized this paper. In this paper, the authors have refined a face recognition algorithm which is unresponsive to the large fluctuation in lighting direction and facial expression. This document also consists of the innovation done in the research, the technical quality of the work done by the authors. Furthermore, it also contains application and x-factor which contains the details of the application domain which is appropriate for the proposed technique. The paper is divided into three different parts:-\n",

        "Content:-At the outset, this paper generates an outline of an innovative approach of the face recognition which is unresponsive to big fluctuations in lightning and facial expressions. Face reorganization can be defined as the problem of verifying and detecting the people in a particular photograph with their face. The pattern classification approach is taken where every pixel in an image acts as a coordinate in the space. The Fisher Linear Discriminant is utilized in the projection method and it generates different classes in a two-dimensional subspace. Another method is the Eigenface technique which is based on projecting the image space linearly into a subspace of lower dimension. \n",

        "  \n",
        "  \n",
        "In this paper the comparison of these two techniques is done which demonstrates that the Fisherface method has error rates which are generally less than that of Eigenface technique. Furthermore, the paper presented and discussed the aforementioned face recognition techniques by using two different databases. (Belhumeur, Hespanha and Kriegman, 1997)\n",
        "\n",
        "On Harvard Robotics Laboratory lightning has been varied systematically. Experiments have been done on fluctuation in lighting and fluctuation in facial expression, eyewear, and lighting. The PCA (principal component analysis) technique is generally utilized for dimensionality reduction in the computer vision. The concept of PCA is explained very well by explaining the formula of the sample images of the total scatter matrix. \n",
        "\n",
        "Innovation: - The research work which is done in this paper is highly innovative. Comparison is done among four methods for the recognition of the face which is under fluctuation the fascial and lightening expression. These four methods are:-\n",
        "•\tCorrelation\n",
        "•\tA fluctuation of the linear subspace method.\n",
        "•\tThe Eigenface method.\n",
        "•\tFisher face method. \n",
        "\n",
        "The innovative technique is applied in such a way that the comparison of the above methods are done by utilizing both a subset of Harvard database which consists of 330 images and Yale database of images which consist of 160 images. In the methods of extrapolation and interpolation, a different number of innovating points were revealed. These include:-\n",
        "•\tAll the algorithms have given their excellent performance in a perfect way when lightning is nearly frontal. But, when lightning is moved off-axis, the performance difference is observed among the two-class specific methods and the Eigenface method. \n",
        "•\tAlso, it has been observed after the experiments that when the number of Eigenface faces equals the size of the training set, the Eigenface method becomes equivalent to the correlation method. \n",
        "•\tBy removing the top three principal components in the Eigenface method, better results are generated under variable lighting conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Technical quality: - The technical quality of the work done in the paper is if extreme high quality. The extrapolation is being performed extremely well in the paper as a particular of the methods are trained on images near front illumination. For all the experiments, the nearest neighbor classifier was utilized for performing the classification. All the images of training data were projected into the feature space. Cropping of images was done within the face. This resulted in the exclusion of the contour of the face. \n",

        "In the method of Extrapolation, every method is trained on images with near frontal illumination. The analogous table is shown above and the graph above gives the relative performance in the extreme conditions of the light sources. (Belhumeur, Hespanha and Kriegman, 1997)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, in interpolation when every method is trained on images from near frontal and extreme lighting, the above table the analogous graph demonstrated the performance in the intermediate conditions of the light. (Belhumeur, Hespanha and Kriegman, 1997)\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Unit variance and zero means were achieved by the normalization of the images in the correlation and Eigenface test. This has improved the performance of the methods. Moreover, two different experiments were done on the database of the Harvard database. These two are defined as extrapolation and interpolation. In the experiment of extrapolation, every method was trained on the samples of the subset 1 and then testing was done by using the samples from subsets 1, 2 and 3.\n",

        "Likewise, in the experiment of interpolation, every method was trained on the Subsets 1 and 5 and then these were tested on the methods on Subset 2, 3 and 4.Different interesting points were revealed by these two methods which make the performance of the algorithm excellent.\n",

        "The face recognition has a wide range of applications as facial biometrics are being applied in many industries, manufacturing, law enforcement, disrupting the design. There are different ways where facial recognition software is affecting the following sectors:-\n",
        "1.)\tPayments: - With the advent of Face recognition technology, the customers will not need any card and the payment will be done by just an app where the customer will open the camera. The eCommerce firm of China Alibaba is planning to apply this technology. \n",
        "2.)\tAccess and security: - Instead of utilizing passcodes, the other electronic devices and mobile phones will be using the facial features of the owner.\n",
        "3.)\tCriminal Identification:-Facilities can be easily protected by keeping out the unauthorized person. The Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States is attempting to using the machine learning algorithm to detect suspicious people from their driver’s license.\n",
        "4.)\tAdvertising: -Some companies are planning to identify some demographics. To exemplify, if a customer is between an age group of 13 to 22 years the latest FIFA advertisements can be displayed to them.\n",
        "5.)\tHealthcare: - From identifying the features of the illness of a patient the doctors and physicians can easily suppress the waiting queue of a large number of patients at a medical center with the help of face recognition technique.  (Cox et al., 2019)\n",
        "In the proposed technique of this research paper, the application domain is appropriate for the proposed technique as in the paper four pattern classification techniques are examined for solving the problem of face recognition. All these are widely used in today’s applications for solving the problem. But, the procedure which is referred to as correlation has many disadvantages. These are:-\n",
        "•\tIf the images in the test set and the learning set are gathered under changing lighting conditions, the clustering of the analogous points in the image space may not be done in a perfect way.\n",
        "•\tThis is an expensive procedure.\n",
        "•\tA huge amount of storage is generally needed in which many images of a particular person is contained in the learning set. \n",
        "In the further development of the research work, the above drawbacks of correlation should be aimed to overcome with a new innovative procedure or method. \n",
        "\n",
        "Presentation: -The presentation of the paper is not very well as it has been confusing to understand at many points. The argument of the paper has included those technical terms which were not easy to understand at the first five readings. In the introduction of the paper, the explanation of the background of numerous algorithms has been explained well which proceeds with a new approach where different applied methods are demonstrated. The explanation of the experimental results has been explained well which includes the explanation of fluctuation in lighting, fluctuation in facial expression, eyewear and lightning, and glasses recognition.\n",
